### Retro

Overall the team was extremely pleased with how well the hackday went.  None of us had any serious game development experience so to come together and slap a few concepts and levels together was amazing!

One thing we noted that helped a lot was pre-coordination.  Having the game engine choosen, a little homework for familiarizing ourselves with unity and right mindset for what really could be done in a day helped tremendously.  That meant that upon arrival we could hit the ground running, there was no need for any kind of intro/welcome/blabla speach.

Good team skillsets was something else we noted, we are a well versed team and we each bring something to the table that is complimentary and not necessarily duplicative.  With our various backgrounds we were able to operate as a team extremely well, self organize around tasks, and found ourselves laughing and having a good time throughout the day. 

Great game choice was also huge.  As cool as the other game choices were (especially the evil Tetris clone) we realized that the concept of moving a ball around a maze made for an extremely simple game to grok in our heads.  It also lent itself very well to parallization of the effort, working on individual components, levels, features, etc  allowed the whole team to work efficiently.

One last thing we all agreed on was that it was completely different and a welcome break from work.  We were able to scratch our creativity itch and not be constrained by customer/client needs in any way.

The only downside we could come up with was our lack of familiarity with Unity and Git.  We spent probably 20-30 minutes each all said and done during the day dealing with everyones slightly different setup of tooling and configuration.  That added up in terms of our total time on target!  Next time we will give a little more leeway and some pre testing of tooling prior to the hackday to helf mitigate some of that.
